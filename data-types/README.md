### GMS2 Data Types

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1000x4/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="4px"/>

This tutorial is intended for those wanting an introduction to <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> using their scrpting language <i>GML</i>. This assumes no prior knowledge of the software or scripting. This walk through looks at [data types](https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Data_Types.htm) in GMS2. Lets looks at the most common built in data types that **GameMaker GML** provides us.  A data type indicates what kind of information a variable holds and how to allocate memory to store it.

* Tested on GameMake Studio2.3.5.589
* An existing [GML Project](https://github.com/maubanel/GMS2-Snippets/blob/main/rename-project/README.md#user-content-rename-gms2-project)

##### `Step 1.`\|`ITB`|:small_blue_diamond:

Lets create a new **room** and look at some more data types.  *Right click* on the **Rooms** title in the **Asset Browser** menu.  *Select* **Create | Room** then change the name to `rm_data_types`.  Open up the **Room Order** item and *drag* **rm_data_types** to the first room in the list.  This is important as **GameMaker** *loads* the first room in this list.  We now want to load this new room (if we have more than one room in our project)!

![create a new room called rm_data_types and make it first in room order list](images/AddTypesRoom.gif)

##### `Step 2.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Lets now create another object that will be responsible for controlling all elements unique to this level.  *Right click* on **Object** in the **Asset Browser** menu, then select **Create | Object** and call it `obj_data_types_controller`.


![add object called boj_data_types_controller](images/objdatatypecontrl.gif)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 3.`\|`ITB`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now in this newly created object  *left click* on the <kbd>Add Event</kbd> button and add a **Draw | Draw** event.

![Add a Draw Event to obj_data_types_controller](images/AddDrawObjDataType.gif)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 4.`\|`ITB`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now lets take a look at the newly created script.  The first line is special and has unique section that has `/// @description` .  This tells the **IDE** that this is the *title* of this script and what follows it shows up in the **Events** list window. *Properly* naming this makes it easier to find code that you wrote previously. 

![Look at special meaning of ///@ description](images/InsertDescriptionHere.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 5.`\|`ITB`| :small_orange_diamond:

Now lets go to this newly created draw event and update the **description** and the first line of help to demonstrate what we will do next.  *Type* the below message and press <kbd>Save</kbd> and see that what follows `/// @description` now shows up in the **Events** window:

![Type comments in obj_data_types_controller object](images/AddDescriptionToDataTypes.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 6.`\|`ITB`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

> "Real numbers are any value that is not a string, nor any of the other possible data types. So, 124, 45639.566546456, 0, -45.5 etc... are all examples of real numbers. All real numbers are stored as double-precision floating point values (even seemingly integer values), so you may experience slight rounding errors when dealing with these." - GameMaker Manual

In **obj_data_types_controller** *press* the <kbd>Variable Definitions</kbd> button. Add a variable named `age` and set the **value** to any random whole number representing a fictional age.  Leave it as type `Real`.  *Add* another variable named `line_height` and set the **Value** to `32`.  We will use this to space each line by **32** pixels.  *Leave* this as a `Real` number.

![Add two new variables to this object called age and line_height](images/TwoFirstVariablesInDataTypes.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 7.`\|`ITB`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Drag an instance of **obj_data_types_controller** to the edge of the new **rm_data_types** room.  You can put it on the outside of the room as it is just there to run code, we will not use its position on screen.

![Drag a copy of obj_data_types_controller to the room](images/AddLevelControllerOffScreen.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 8.`\|`ITB`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Go to the **obj_data_types_controller | Draw** event script window.  Start by *aligning* the text to the horizontal center.  Then draw the text and don't use the built in x and y variables. Since we placed it off screen we will position the text where we want it.  We will use **room_width** times **0.5** (same as dividing the room_width variable by half).  We set the **y** value at our current **line_height** variable.  Then we reset the horizontal alignment to its default. Type the following into your draw script to perform the above.

![dd script to print age on screen](images/DrawFirstLineScript.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 9.`\|`ITB`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Make sure that in **Room Order** that  **rm_data_types** on top. This way it will run this room first. Then run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game.  You should see the age you entered printed in the top center of the screen:

![Run game and see age printed on top of game screen](images/ReorderRoom.gif)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 10.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond:

Now we can do other things with real numbers, we can perform mathematical operations on them.  So we can evaluate: 52 + 20 * 2.  Remember the order of operations, as this will evaluate as *52 + (20 * 2)*.  So lets make this change and add a second line to our on screen text.  We advance the **Y** value by *multiplying* **line_height** by `2`.  This will move it down one line.  We will also not use the real number `52`, we will use the variable **age**. *Add* another comment to the line.

![Enter second line with mathematical operation](images/AddSecondLineMathOp.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 11.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game.  You should see the second line that clearly state 92.  This means that the order of operations behaved as we expected.

![Run game with two ages printed on screen](images/MathOperationsInGame.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>


##### `Step 12.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Lets clean up a few things.  The spacing is a bit too big for the font that is default on my computer.  Go to the **Variable Definitions** tab and change the **Value | line_height** to `22`.

![Alter line_height to 22](images/ChangeLineHeight.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 13.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Go back to the **Draw** event script and put brackets around the multiplication.  Even though this makes no difference, it will help you or others to better understand what you mean.  There is no downside to being more explicit, the compiler will generate the same end result.  It is just a clearer expression of your intent.

![Add parenthesis for mathematical operations](images/OrderOfOps.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 14.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game.  You should see a tighter spacing that looks a bit better.  Notice that the answer is still 91 so the brackets did not change anything in the execution.

![Run game with two different ages with improved line spacing](images/NewlySpacedSecondLine.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 15.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: 

The final data type we will look at for now is called a **Boolean**.  A boolean resolves to either 1 (true) or 0 (false). It is preferable to use the words true  and false when refering intead of 0 and 1.  But if you print a boolean value we will only see the number.  

In **GameMaker** any real number above .5 will resolve to true and any number less will be false.  Now we can't select a boolean type we need to cast a real number to a boolean.  We do this by typing (bool)real_number_to_convert.  So lets add two more lines and print the boolean result of 3 and -300.

![Add two new prints printing a true and false boolean](images/BooleanTrueAndFalse.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 16.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond:   :small_blue_diamond: 

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game.  You should see a tighter spacing that looks a bit better.  Did you see what you expected. According to the above rules the 3 resolved to true and the -300 resolved to false.

![Run game with two more boolean messages](images/BooleanExpressionInGame.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 17.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Previously we were able to add two real numbers together to perform a mathematical operation.  We can also combine strings together.  Instead of a mathematical operation it performs a concatonation.  It puts both strings together as a longer string.

Lets add a fifth line to the printing and concatonate some strings.  Lets *add* two more **Variable Definitions | Variables** to the `obj_data_types_controller`.  We will add a **Name** `first_name` and `last_name` making them both `String` **Type**. I added a **Default** of `Bob` for first name and `Smith` for last name.

![Add two variables first_name and last_name](images/AddLastAndFirstName.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 18.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now lets string a sentence together.  We can *concatonate* string varialbes with strings. We also need spaces between words.  So we can *add* `"Hello " + first_name + " " + last_name + "!"` as a fifth line.  *Add* the following 5th text string to our **Draw** script:

![Concatonate multiple strings](images/StringConcatonation.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 19.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game.  You should see an entire sentence print on the fifth line as it combines all the strings together.

![Run game and see concatonated sentence](images/StringConcatonationInGame.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 20.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond:

So a real number + a real number will perform an addition.  A string + a string will perform a concatonation.  What if we add a string to a real number together.  Lets give it a try. Go back to the first line we printed and add the string and real number "I am " + age + " years old."

![Add a real and string together](images/ConcatonateStringAndReal.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 21.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game.  Woops we now get our first run time error.  What does this mean?  This means it compiles succesfully but when that line is run in game (it is run right away) it asserts to an error. The error tells us which script it is in and the event type (Draw Event obj_data_types_controller).  The error message "DoAdd" isn't very helpful.  Essentially GameMaker can't handle adding a String and a Real number together.  But there is a solution.

![Run game and get a runtime error](images/RunTimeConcatonationError.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 22.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Just as we cast a real number to a boolean we can cast a **Real Number** to a **String**.  What casting does is changes from one data type to another.  There is a function called `string()` in which it casts the value to a string data type. *Edit* the script and pass the **age** real number variable as an argument to the `string()` function.

![Cast real to string](images/CastRealToString.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 23.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game. It works fine as we are back to concatonating multiple strings together because of the cast.

![Run game and see concatonated casted string and real number](images/StringCastConcatonationInGame.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 24.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now inside the cast we can still perform arithmetic operations on the real numbers and it will perform this before casting it to a string.  On the second line surround the mathematical operation with a string(age + (20 * 2)) like so:
	
```
//Performs mathematical operation on second line<br>
draw_text(room_width * .5, line_height * 2, "In 40 years I will be " + string(age + (20 * 2)) + "." );
```

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 25.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: 

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Now it concatonates the two strings but only after it has performed the arithmetic operations:

![Run game it still performs cast on the result of a mathematical problem](images/DoMathAndConcatonateInGame.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 26.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Even cooler is that we can nest casts.  So we can cast the (bool)real_number to a string.  Lets make a sentence out of our boolean comparisons and double cast:

```
"3 in boolean resolves to: " + string(bool(3))
"-300 in boolean resolves to: " +  string(bool(-300)) 
```

![Double cast and stringefy a bool in a nester structure](images/DoubleCast.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 27.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now run the game by pressing the <kbd>Play</kbd> Button in the top menu bar to launch the game. All the lines are now concatonating strings that are cast from either booleans or real numbers.

![Run game and see a double cast concatonation](images/DoubleCastInGame.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 28.`\|`ITB`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Select the **File | Save Project** then press **File | Quit** to make sure everything in the game is saved. If you are using **GitHub** open up **GitHub Desktop** and add a title and longer description (if necessary) and press the <kbd>Commit to main</kbd> button. Finish by pressing **Push origin** to update the server with the latest changes.
